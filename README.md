**30Cent** or **30₡** is a unique modular multi-layout ortholinear keyboard with *south-facing* MX sockets. It combines the functionalities of 30%, 40%, and 60% keyboards, allowing users to customize their layout. By removing the top and bottom rows, the keyboard can be transformed from a 5-row layout to a 4-row or 3-row layouts.Alternatively, users can keep the full layout intact to resemble a 60% keyboard, featuring a unique top row, that can be mounted either flat or at an angle.

The top row of the keyboard features two independent rotary encoders, eight function keys (or ten without the encoders), and a 0.91" I²C screen. The screen can be used to display various information, such as a WPM counter for typing speed.

The bottom row of the keyboard supports multiple space configurations. Users can choose between ultra-long options like 10U and 7U, or go with the standard 6.25U size. Additionally, there is a split configuration available, which consists of 1.50U + 2.25U + 2.25U + 1.50U.

Furthermore, the keyboard offers the flexibility to attach the top row at an angle using a FFC (Flexible Flat Cable), resulting in a truly unique and compact keyboard design.

## Features
- **Multi-layout Design**: Combines the functionalities of 30%, 40%, and 60% keyboards, allowing for versatile customization of the keyboard layout.
- **Breakable Top and Bottom Rows**: The ability to break off the top and bottom rows, transforming the keyboard from a forty-key layout to a thirty-key layout.
- **Unique Top Row**: Retains a unique top row even when the full layout is intact, providing a distinct design element.
- **Dual Rotary Encoders**: Supports two independent encoders on the top row for enhanced control and customization.
**Function Keys**: Features eight function keys (or ten without the knobs) for convenient access to additional commands.
**0.91" I²C Screen**: Top row includes a 0.91" I²C screen for displaying various information, such as a WPM counter for typing speed.
- **Multiple Space Configuration**s: Offers options for the bottom row space, including ultra-long configurations (10U and 7U), standard 6.25U, and a split configuration (1.50U + 2.25U + 2.25U + 1.50U). Additionally, users have the option to use two 2U keys as spaces if the bottom row is not being utilized.
- **Angled Top Row Attachment**: Provides the ability to attach the top row at an angle using a Flexible Flat Cable (FFC), resulting in a unique keyboard design.
- **MX Sockets**: Compatible with MX sockets, allowing for easy switch customization and replacement.
- **Optional Key Backlighting**: Offers the option for key backlighting, enhancing visibility and aesthetics in low-light environments.
- **Unique Breakable PCB Design**: The PCB is designed to be breakable, allowing for easy detachment and reattachment of top and bottom rows, facilitating customization of the keyboard layout.
