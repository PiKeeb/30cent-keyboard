## Production Instructions

### File Naming Convention

Due to modular nature, 30Cent keyboard has many parts. Each part corresponds to either the top, middle or bottom module of the keyboard.

`MiddleBody` is the center part of the assembly.

Parts that start with `Middle*` attach to the `MiddleBody` to form 30% layout.

Parts that start with `Top*` or `Bottom*` are used to attach the top and bottom rows respectively.

### Case Threads

ALL the threads on the case are standard M2.5. Threads should go inside the holes as deep as possible.

Thread locations for each part are below.
